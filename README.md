# Object-Oriented-C-Course

These are the codes of the assignments I did for my Object Oriented Programming in C++ course at the University of Manchester.

The C++ features I learned from this course are:
1. The basic properties of C++: constants; boolean data-types; pointers and references; dynamic memory allocation; function overloading.
2. Data streams: standard input/output; managing files.
3. Classes  and  objects:  encapsulation;  access  functions;  constructors  and  destructors;  arrays  of  objects;  friends;  operator  overloadingsic properties of;  assignment  operator;  shallow  and  deep  copying;  this  pointer.
4. Inheritance:   base   and   derived   classes;   access   specifiers;   overriding   functions;   multiple   inheritance.
5. Polymorphism:  base  class  pointers;  abstract  base  classes;  virtual  and  pure  virtual  functions;  interface classes. 
6.Structuring programs: header files; multiple source files; namespaces.
7.Advanced C++ features: static data; templates; runtime type checking; error handling and exceptions.
8.The C++ Standard Library; the boost library; other libraries.
